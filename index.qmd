title: "PolarWatch Data Management"
---

This repository serves as a  resource for the data management practices of PolarWatch, detailing the organization's approach to handling remote sensing data served on PolarWatch servers. It includes documents and plans dedicated to the management of data throughout its lifecycle.

### Data Management Plan (DMP) 
A Data Management Plan (DMP) is a living document that details the data lifecycle, encompassing data creation, processing, access, ownership, and management strategies and tools.

The objective of PolarWatch is to disseminate remote sensing data, ensuring they are readily available. Consequently, the PolarWatch DMP focuses on aspects of the data lifecycle pertinent to its operations, such as data ingestion, processing, quality control, and management.
