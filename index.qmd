This repository includes documents and plans of PolarWatch data management.

### Data Management Plan (DMP) 
A Data Management Plan (DMP) is a living document that details the data lifecycle, encompassing data creation, processing, access, ownership, and management strategies and tools.

The objective of PolarWatch is to disseminate remote sensing data, ensuring they are readily available. Consequently, the PolarWatch DMP focuses on aspects of the data lifecycle pertinent to its operations, such as data ingestion, processing, quality control, and management.
