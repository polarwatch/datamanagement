# NOAA Data Management Handbook
> Updated October 4, 2024


The official NOAA Data Management Handbook was released on October 1, 2024, providing comprehensive guidelines and requirements for managing data throughout its life cycle. 

We highlight several key topics relevant to PolarWatch operations, as PolarWatch focuses on processing, managing, and distributing environmental data, particularly satellite-derived data, to support oceanographic and polar research. In addition, we provide easy access to key resources from the handbook to support our collaborators in adhering to the guidelines.
