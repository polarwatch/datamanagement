    "text": "Updated March 20, 2024\n\nHere are the metadata guidelines for data products intended for hosting on the PolarWatch ERDDAP Server. The metadata attributes and descriptions are created following the widely recognized industry convention standards, as indicated in the Standard column.\n\nAttribute Convention for Data Discovery(ACDD)\nGlobal Change Master Directory (GCMD)\nNetCDF Climate and Forecast (CF)\nNational Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)\n\nLink to a template (excel sheet)\nFor any questions or assistance, please contact PolarWatch Ops Manager at polar.watch@noaa.gov\n\n\nGlobal attributes provide information about the data set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttribute Name\nDescription\nStandards\n\n\n\n\ntitle\nA short phrase or sentence describing the dataset. In many discovery systems, the title will be displayed in the results list from a search, and therefore should be human readable and reasonable to display in a list of such names. This attribute is also recommended by the NetCDF Users Guide and the CF conventions.\nACDD\n\n\nsummary\nA paragraph describing the dataset, analogous to an abstract for a paper.\nACDD\n\n\nkeywords\n\nACDD, GCMD\n\n\nConventions\nA comma-separated list of the conventions that are followed by the dataset. For files that follow this version of ACDD, include the string ‘ACDD-1.3’. (This attribute is described in the NetCDF Users Guide.)\nACDD, CF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttribute Name\nDescription\nStandards\n\n\n\n\nncei_template_version\n\nNCEI\n\n\nid\nAn identifier for the data set, provided by and unique within its naming authority. The combination of the “naming authority” and the “id” should be globally unique, but the id can be globally unique by itself also. IDs can be URLs, URNs, DOIs, meaningful text strings, a local key, or any other unique string of characters. The id should not include white space characters.\nACDD\n\n\nnaming_authority\nThe organization that provides the initial id (see above) for the dataset. The naming authority should be uniquely specified by this attribute. We recommend using reverse-DNS naming for the naming authority; URIs are also acceptable. Example: ‘edu.ucar.unidata’.\nACDD\n\n\nhistory\nProvides an audit trail for modifications to the original data. This attribute is also in the NetCDF Users Guide: ‘This is a character array with a line for each invocation of a program that has modified the dataset. Well-behaved generic netCDF applications should append a line containing: date, time of day, user name, program name and command arguments.’ To include a more complete description you can append a reference to an ISO Lineage entity; see NOAA EDM ISO Lineage guidance.\nACDD\n\n\nsource\nThe method of production of the original data. If it was model-generated, source should name the model and its version. If it is observational, source should characterize it. This attribute is defined in the CF Conventions. Examples: ‘temperature from CTD #1234’; ‘world model v.0.1’.\nACDD\n\n\nprocessing_level\nA textual description of the processing (or quality control) level of the data.\nACDD\n\n\ncomment\nMiscellaneous information about the data, not captured elsewhere. This attribute is defined in the CF Conventions.\nACDD\n\n\nacknowledgement\nProvide the URL to a standard or specific license, enter “Freely Distributed” or “None”, or describe any restrictions to data access and distribution in free text.\nACDD\n\n\nlicense\nCreative Commons Universal Public Domain Dedication (CC0-1.0) for All Internal NOAA Source Data that are appropriate for public release with no restrictions on use … should be formally dedicated to the public domain using the Creative Commons Universal Public Domain Dedication (CC0-1.0), which provides legal confirmation that the data may be used by anyone, for any purpose.\nACDD\n\n\nstandard_name_vocabulary\nThe name and version of the controlled vocabulary from which variable standard names are taken. (Values for any standard_name attribute must come from the CF Standard Names vocabulary for the data file or product to comply with CF.) Example: ‘CF Standard Name Table v27’.\nACDD\n\n\ndate_created\nThe date on which this version of the data was created. (Modification of values implies a new version, hence this would be assigned the date of the most recent values modification.) Metadata changes are not considered when assigning the date_created. The ISO 8601:2004 extended date format is recommended, as described in the Attribute Content Guidance section.\nACDD\n\n\ncreator_name\nThe name of the person (or other creator type specified by the creator_type attribute) principally responsible for creating this data.\nACDD\n\n\ncreator_email\nThe email address of the person (or other creator type specified by the creator_type attribute) principally responsible for creating this data.\nACDD\n\n\ncreator_url\nThe URL of the person (or other creator type specified by the creator_type attribute) principally responsible for creating this data.\nACDD\n\n\ninstitution\nThe name of the institution principally responsible for originating this data. This attribute is recommended by the CF convention.\nACDD\n\n\nproject\nThe name of the project(s) principally responsible for originating this data. Multiple projects can be separated by commas, as described under Attribute Content Guidelines. Examples: ‘PATMOS-X’, ‘Extended Continental Shelf Project’.\nACDD\n\n\npublisher_name\nThe name of the person (or other entity specified by the publisher_type attribute) responsible for publishing the data file or product to users, with its current metadata and format.\nACDD\n\n\npublisher_email\nThe email address of the person (or other entity specified by the publisher_type attribute) responsible for publishing the data file or product to users, with its current metadata and format.\nACDD\n\n\npublisher_url\nThe URL of the person (or other entity specified by the publisher_type attribute) responsible for publishing the data file or product to users, with its current metadata and format.\nACDD\n\n\ngeospatial_bounds\nDescribes the data’s 2D or 3D geospatial extent in OGC’s Well-Known Text (WKT) Geometry format (reference the OGC Simple Feature Access (SFA) specification). The meaning and order of values for each point’s coordinates depends on the coordinate reference system (CRS). The ACDD default is 2D geometry in the EPSG:4326 coordinate reference system. The default may be overridden with geospatial_bounds_crs and geospatial_bounds_vertical_crs (see those attributes). EPSG:4326 coordinate values are latitude (decimal degrees_north) and longitude (decimal degrees_east), in that order. Longitude values in the default case are limited to the [-180, 180) range. Example: ‘POLYGON ((40.26 -111.29, 41.26 -111.29, 41.26 -110.29, 40.26 -110.29, 40.26 -111.29))’.\nACDD\n\n\ngeospatial_bounds_crs\nThe coordinate reference system (CRS) of the point coordinates in the geospatial_bounds attribute. This CRS may be 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional, but together with geospatial_bounds_vertical_crs, if that attribute is supplied, must match the dimensionality, order, and meaning of point coordinate values in the geospatial_bounds attribute. If geospatial_bounds_vertical_crs is also present then this attribute must only specify a 2D CRS. EPSG CRSs are strongly recommended. If this attribute is not specified, the CRS is assumed to be EPSG:4326. Examples: ‘EPSG:4979’ (the 3D WGS84 CRS), ‘EPSG:4047’.\nACDD\n\n\ngeospatial_bounds_vertical_crs\nThe vertical coordinate reference system (CRS) for the Z axis of the point coordinates in the geospatial_bounds attribute. This attribute cannot be used if the CRS in geospatial_bounds_crs is 3-dimensional; to use this attribute, geospatial_bounds_crs must exist and specify a 2D CRS. EPSG CRSs are strongly recommended. There is no default for this attribute when not specified. Examples: ‘EPSG:5829’ (instantaneous height above sea level), “EPSG:5831” (instantaneous depth below sea level), or ‘EPSG:5703’ (NAVD88 height).\nACDD\n\n\ngeospatial_lat_min\nDescribes a simple lower latitude limit; may be part of a 2- or 3-dimensional bounding region. Geospatial_lat_min specifies the southernmost latitude covered by the dataset.\nACDD\n\n\ngeospatial_lat_max\nDescribes a simple upper latitude limit; may be part of a 2- or 3-dimensional bounding region.

See also geospatial_lon_max.\nACDD\n\n\ngeospatial_lon_max\nDescribes a simple longitude limit; may be part of a 2- or 3-dimensional bounding region. geospatial_lon_max specifies the easternmost longitude covered by the dataset. Cases where geospatial_lon_min is greater than geospatial_lon_max indicate the bounding box extends from geospatial_lon_max, through the longitude range discontinuity meridian (either the antimeridian for -180:180 values, or Prime Meridian for 0:360 values), to geospatial_lon_min; for example, geospatial_lon_min=170 and geospatial_lon_max=-175 incorporates 15 degrees of longitude (ranges 170 to 180 and -180 to -175).\nACDD\n\n\ngeospatial_vertical_min\nDescribes the numerically smaller vertical limit; may be part of a 2- or 3-dimensional bounding region. See geospatial_vertical_positive and geospatial_vertical_units.\nACDD\n\n\ngeospatial_vertical_max\nDescribes the numerically larger vertical limit; may be part of a 2- or 3-dimensional bounding region. See geospatial_vertical_positive and geospatial_vertical_units.\nACDD\n\n\ngeospatial_vertical_positive\nOne of ‘up’ or ‘down’. If up, vertical values are interpreted as ‘altitude’, with negative values corresponding to below the reference datum (e.g., under water). If down, vertical values are interpreted as ‘depth’, positive values correspond to below the reference datum. Note that if geospatial_vertical_positive is down (‘depth’ orientation), the geospatial_vertical_min attribute specifies the data’s vertical location furthest from the earth’s center, and the geospatial_vertical_max attribute specifies the location closest to the earth’s center.\nACDD\n\n\ntime_coverage_start\nDescribes the time of the first data point in the data set. Use ISO 8601:2004 date format, preferably the extended format as recommended in the Attribute Content Guidance section.\nACDD\n\n\ntime_coverage_end\nDescribes the time of the last data point in the data set.

The default is EPSG:4979 (height above the ellipsoid, in meters); other vertical coordinate reference systems may be specified. Note that the common oceanographic practice of using pressure for a vertical coordinate, while not strictly a depth, can be specified using the unit bar. Examples: ‘EPSG:5829’ (instantaneous height above sea level), ‘EPSG:5831’ (instantaneous depth below sea level).\nACDD\n\n\ngeospatial_vertical_resolution\nInformation about the targeted vertical spacing of points. Example: ‘25 meters’\nACDD\n\n\ndate_modified\nThe date on which the data was last modified. Note that this applies just to the data, not the metadata.

The combination of the “naming authority” and the “id” should be globally unique, but the id can be globally unique by itself also. IDs can be URLs, URNs, DOIs, meaningful text strings, a local key, or any other unique string of characters. The id should not include white space characters.\nACDD\n\n\nnaming_authority\nThe organization that provides the initial id (see above) for the dataset. The naming authority should be uniquely specified by this attribute. We recommend using reverse-DNS naming for the naming authority; URIs are also acceptable. Example: ‘edu.ucar.unidata’.\nACDD\n\n\nhistory\nProvides an audit trail for modifications to the original data. This attribute is also in the NetCDF Users Guide: ‘This is a character array with a line for each invocation of a program that has modified the dataset. Well-behaved generic netCDF applications should append a line containing: date, time of day, user name, program name and command arguments.’ To include a more complete description you can append a reference to an ISO Lineage entity; see NOAA EDM ISO Lineage guidance.\nACDD\n\n\nsource\nThe method of production of the original data. If it was model-generated, source should name the model and its version. If it is observational, source should characterize it. This attribute is defined in the CF Conventions.

Example: ‘CF Standard Name Table v27’.\nACDD\n\n\ndate_created\nThe date on which this version of the data was created. (Modification of values implies a new version, hence this would be assigned the date of the most recent values modification.) Metadata changes are not considered when assigning the date_created. The ISO 8601:2004 extended date format is recommended, as described in the Attribute Content Guidance section.\nACDD\n\n\ncreator_name\nThe name of the person (or other creator type specified by the creator_type attribute) principally responsible for creating this data.\nACDD\n\n\ncreator_email\nThe email address of the person (or other creator type specified by the creator_type attribute) principally responsible for creating this data.\nACDD\n\n\ncreator_url\nThe URL of the person (or other creator type specified by the creator_type attribute) principally responsible for creating this data.\nACDD\n\n\ninstitution\nThe name of the institution principally responsible for originating this data.

The meaning and order of values for each point’s coordinates depends on the coordinate reference system (CRS). The ACDD default is 2D geometry in the EPSG:4326 coordinate reference system. The default may be overridden with geospatial_bounds_crs and geospatial_bounds_vertical_crs (see those attributes). EPSG:4326 coordinate values are latitude (decimal degrees_north) and longitude (decimal degrees_east), in that order. Longitude values in the default case are limited to the [-180, 180) range. Example: ‘POLYGON ((40.26 -111.29, 41.26 -111.29, 41.26 -110.29, 40.26 -110.29, 40.26 -111.29))’.\nACDD\n\n\ngeospatial_bounds_crs\nThe coordinate reference system (CRS) of the point coordinates in the geospatial_bounds attribute. This CRS may be 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional, but together with geospatial_bounds_vertical_crs, if that attribute is supplied, must match the dimensionality, order, and meaning of point coordinate values in the geospatial_bounds attribute. If geospatial_bounds_vertical_crs is also present then this attribute must only specify a 2D CRS. EPSG CRSs are strongly recommended. If this attribute is not specified, the CRS is assumed to be EPSG:4326. Examples: ‘EPSG:4979’ (the 3D WGS84 CRS), ‘EPSG:4047’.\nACDD\n\n\ngeospatial_bounds_vertical_crs\nThe vertical coordinate reference system (CRS) for the Z axis of the point coordinates in the geospatial_bounds attribute. This attribute cannot be used if the CRS in geospatial_bounds_crs is 3-dimensional; to use this attribute, geospatial_bounds_crs must exist and specify a 2D CRS. EPSG CRSs are strongly recommended. There is no default for this attribute when not specified. Examples: ‘EPSG:5829’ (instantaneous height above sea level), “EPSG:5831” (instantaneous depth below sea level), or ‘EPSG:5703’ (NAVD88 height).\nACDD\n\n\ngeospatial_lat_min\nDescribes a simple lower latitude limit; may be part of a 2- or 3-dimensional bounding region. Geospatial_lat_min specifies the southernmost latitude covered by the dataset.\nACDD\n\n\ngeospatial_lat_max\nDescribes a simple upper latitude limit; may be part of a 2- or 3-dimensional bounding region. Geospatial_lat_max specifies the northernmost latitude covered by the dataset.\nACDD\n\n\ngeospatial_lon_min\nDescribes a simple longitude limit; may be part of a 2- or 3-dimensional bounding region. geospatial_lon_min specifies the westernmost longitude covered by the dataset. See also geospatial_lon_max.\nACDD\n\n\ngeospatial_lon_max\nDescribes a simple longitude limit; may be part of a 2- or 3-dimensional bounding region. geospatial_lon_max specifies the easternmost longitude covered by the dataset. Cases where geospatial_lon_min is greater than geospatial_lon_max indicate the bounding box extends from geospatial_lon_max, through the longitude range discontinuity meridian (either the antimeridian for -180:180 values, or Prime Meridian for 0:360 values), to geospatial_lon_min; for example, geospatial_lon_min=170 and geospatial_lon_max=-175 incorporates 15 degrees of longitude (ranges 170 to 180 and -180 to -175).\nACDD\n\n\ngeospatial_vertical_min\nDescribes the numerically smaller vertical limit; may be part of a 2- or 3-dimensional bounding region. See geospatial_vertical_positive and geospatial_vertical_units.\nACDD\n\n\ngeospatial_vertical_max\nDescribes the numerically larger vertical limit; may be part of a 2- or 3-dimensional bounding region. See geospatial_vertical_positive and geospatial_vertical_units.\nACDD\n\n\ngeospatial_vertical_positive\nOne of ‘up’ or ‘down’. If up, vertical values are interpreted as ‘altitude’, with negative values corresponding to below the reference datum (e.g., under water). If down, vertical values are interpreted as ‘depth’, positive values correspond to below the reference datum. Note that if geospatial_vertical_positive is down (‘depth’ orientation), the geospatial_vertical_min attribute specifies the data’s vertical location furthest from the earth’s center, and the geospatial_vertical_max attribute specifies the location closest to the earth’s center.\nACDD\n\n\ntime_coverage_start\nDescribes the time of the first data point in the data set.

Note that the common oceanographic practice of using pressure for a vertical coordinate, while not strictly a depth, can be specified using the unit bar. Examples: ‘EPSG:5829’ (instantaneous height above sea level), ‘EPSG:5831’ (instantaneous depth below sea level).\nACDD\n\n\ngeospatial_vertical_resolution\nInformation about the targeted vertical spacing of points. Example: ‘25 meters’\nACDD\n\n\ndate_modified\nThe date on which the data was last modified. Note that this applies just to the data, not the metadata. The ISO 8601:2004 extended date format is recommended, as described in the Attributes Content Guidance section.\nACDD\n\n\ndate_issued\nThe date on which this data (including all modifications) was formally issued (i.e., made available to a wider audience). Note that these apply just to the data, not the metadata. The ISO 8601:2004 extended date format is recommended, as described in the Attributes Content Guidance section.\nACDD\n\n\ndate_metadata_modified\nThe date on which the metadata was last modified. The ISO 8601:2004 extended date format is recommended, as described in the Attributes Content Guidance section.\nACDD\n\n\nproduct_version\nVersion identifier of the data file or product as assigned by the data creator. For example, a new algorithm or methodology could result in a new product_version.\nACDD\n\n\nkeywords_vocabulary\nIf you are using a controlled vocabulary for the words/phrases in your “keywords” attribute, this is the unique name or identifier of the vocabulary from which keywords are taken. If more than one keyword vocabulary is used, each may be presented with a prefix and a following comma, so that keywords may optionally be prefixed with the controlled vocabulary key. Example: ‘GCMD:GCMD Keywords, CF:NetCDF COARDS Climate and Forecast Standard Names’.\nACDD\n\n\nplatform\nName of the platform(s) that supported the sensor data used to create this data set or product. Platforms can be of any type, including satellite, ship, station, aircraft or other. Indicate controlled vocabulary used in platform_vocabulary.\nACDD\n\n\nplatform_vocabulary\nControlled vocabulary for the names used in the “platform” attribute.\nACDD\n\n\ninstrument\nName of the contributing instrument(s) or sensor(s) used to create this data set or product.

The checklist has been improved based on further research and user feedback. Definitions for some concepts are listed at the end of this document. This checklist is developed through a collaboration of ESIP Data Readiness Cluster members include representatives from NOAA, NASA, USGS, and other organizations. The checklist will be updated periodically to reflect community feedback.\nLink to the google sheet\n\n\nIdeally for AI-ready assessment, a dataset should be defined as the minimum measurable bundle (i.e., a physical parameter/variable of observational datasets or model simulations). The assessment at this scale will enable better integration of data from different sources for research and development. However, it can be an intensive process for manual assessment without automation. Therefore, we recommend current assessments be done on the data file level. If the dataset has different versions, the checklist should be applied to each dataset type (e.g. raw, derived).\n\n\n\n\nESIP Data Readiness Cluster (2023): Checklist to Examine AI-readiness for Open Environmental Datasets v.1.0.
